Gatsby test blog
===========================

Overview
---------------------------
A simple blog app made with GatsbyJS and hosted in Netlify. It is up and running [here](https://rnmcgatsbyblog.netlify.com/)

This project was made possible due to the curiosity of learning at least the basics on Gatsby and to keep on practising GraphQL. It is just a simple blog where you can post and read posts. Only the admin can upload blog posts, there is no signup or signin system as I wanted to keep it as simple as it could be.

I have put this app together following Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang's proposed exercise on their ["Complete React Developer in 2020" Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). Props to them, I learned way more of what I imagine I would get of an online course. They explained in detail, gave plenty of examples and really pushed me up to become a better React developer. I definitely recommend it!

As for my other projects, please feel free to go to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/RenzoMurinaCadierno) to check them out. I am still on my learning tracks, so you will see new projects frequently. I specialize in Python and Javascript, and whatever I upload is normally related to web, game and app development, or Python scripting for multiple purposes.


What I learned from this project
---------------------------
- GraphQL is outstanding. It is a brand new world to me, but I can already see why it has so much power. The ability to filter queries and batch them up is certainly worth considering. Though however, much is there in stock for me to learn, as I've only just scratched the bare surface of it.
- As for GatsbyJS, it is indeed something new I am yet not familiar with, that's why the blog remains basic. Nevertheless, as for what server-side HTML generation goes, it is a very nice alternative to create-react-app, which I have been using up to now. Many times you should not delegate rendering to clients' browsers but do it in your own backend, and Gatsby shines for this. So, it is to keep in mind for those ocassions.
- Netlify offers one of the easiest alternatives to host static websites I encountered since I've started programming a year ago. It is just like Glitch or Github Pages, a couple of clicks and there you go. Definitely worth cheking it out.
