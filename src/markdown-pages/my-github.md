Here's the link to [my github portfolio](https://github.com/RenzoMurinaCadierno).

You will find all sorts of projects there. I'm still on my learning tracks, so it grows constantly. I focus on Javascript and Python for Web and app development, and general scripting.

Currently I'm busy with some React projects, since I want to expand my knowledge on those.
